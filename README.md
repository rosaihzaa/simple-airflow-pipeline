# üóùÔ∏è Extract Load Transform Using Airflow

This **ELT** (Extract Load Transform) pipeline using Apache Airflow to scrape property data from [Properstar](https://www.properstar.com/), load it into BigQuery, and transform the data with SQL.

## üîóPipeline Overview
![ELT Pipeline](workflow_dag.jpg)

**`extract_task` >> `load_task` >> `transform_task`**
## ‚õìÔ∏è Task Dependencies

- **`extract_task` ‚Üí `load_task`**
  - `extract_task` is the **upstream** of `load_task`
  - `load_task` is the **downstream** of `extract_task`

- **`load_task` ‚Üí `transform_task`**
  - `load_task` is the **upstream** of `transform_task`
  - `transform_task` is the **downstream** of `load_task`

Each task only runs after its upstream task has completed successfully. This ensures the data flows smoothly and consistently from extraction, through loading, and into the transformation phase.
### üîóExtract
  The `extract_task` performs **web scraping** from [Properstar](https://www.properstar.com/), a property listing site that offers various types of real estate, such as houses, apartments, and villas.

- Scrapes property data (raw) including:

### üîóLoad
  **`load_task`** is responsible for loading the extracted data from extract_task into Google BigQuery. The raw data is inserted into the specified BigQuery table, preparing it for the next transformation stage.
### üîóTransform
**`transform_task`** is responsible for transforming the raw data loaded into BigQuery. At this stage, the data is processed using SQL to clean, filter, and modify it to make it ready for further analysis.

Common tasks in **`transform_task`** include:
- **Filtering**: Removing unnecessary data.
- **Aggregation**: Summing or averaging values for analysis.
- **Normalization**: Standardizing the format or scale of the data.

This transformation step prepares the data for use in reporting, visualization, or further analysis.
## Installation
**Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rosaihzaa/simple-airflow-pipeline.git
   ```
**Create a Virtual Environment:**

   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  
   ```
**Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
